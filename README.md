# passgo [fork [`github.com/ejcx/passgo`](https://github.com/ejcx/passgo)]
## A nifty password and file manager utilizing AEAD/NaCl encryption, written in golang.  
## Package Author @ [`github.com/ejcx`](https://github.com/ejcx)  
## Mods/Settings [very minor]:  
- `passgo.go` @ `usage = ...` tabs converted to spaces [1tab = 2sp]; added `insertfile` usage  
- `passgo.go` @ line 27, set flag to `true`; password sent to clipboard instead of stdout  
   `copyPass = flag.Bool("copy", true,...`
